                <p class="paraText">Arian Joy Vensolan Deniega is 
                a 19-year-old girl born on March 15, 2005, in Sorsogon City. 
                She is currently a second-year college student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Criminology 
                at Sorsogon College of Criminology Inc. Her parents are Annie Vensolan Deniega, who works as 
                a street sweeper, and Arwin Dones Deniega, an auto mechanic. Arian has three younger brothers: 
                the second eldest, Wilmar Jay V. Deniega, is set to graduate from senior high school next year; 
                Arjay V. Deniega is in Grade 10 at Sorsogon National High School, the same school as Wilmar Jay; 
                and the youngest, Winsley V. Deniega, is a Grade 3 student at Pilot Elementary School. Arian Joy 
                dedicated her life to caring for her brothers, who have Hemophilia A, while also pursuing her studies.
                 Despite these responsibilities, she didn't let them hinder her passions. In elementary school, 
                 she participated in majorettes at San Lorenzo Elementary School. Although she didn’t continue this 
                 in high school, she stayed focused on achieving her dreams. </p>

                <p class="paraText"> Reflecting on her life, Arian feels 
                    saddened by the numerous challenges she faced at a young age, but she acknowledges that these 
                    experiences have made her stronger, more independent, and a better person. She has many dislikes
                     but a few things she enjoys, such as staying home to watch movies and share food with her family. 
                     Additionally, she loves watching dance videos and writing poetry.
                    Arian dislikes being interrupted 
                    while working on homework or chores. Despite these quirks, it’s clear that her family shares a 
                    strong bond and remains united despite the challenges they've faced. In her early years, Arian Joy 
                    spent most of her time either at home or at school, rarely venturing out. Throughout high school, 
                    she remained dedicated to her studies and church activities. In grade 11, she chose to join the 
                    dance ministry at her church. After graduating from senior high school, she faced significant
                    pressure due to her college course options. Unfortunately, she was not accepted into Sorsogon 
                    State University or Bicol University. However, after persistent prayer, she received the joyful 
                    news that she was admitted to Sorsogon College of Criminology Inc. Through these experiences, 
                    she learned valuable lessons, including that sometimes our plans may fail because something better is meant to happen.</p>
