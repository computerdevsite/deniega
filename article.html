                <h2>What is Plagiarism?</h2>
                <p>Plagiarism is the act of presenting someone else’s work as your own, without proper citation. This includes copying text, ideas, images, or even code without permission or giving proper credit. Plagiarism can be intentional or unintentional, but either way, it is unethical and can lead to severe consequences.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Properly Cite Sources:</strong> Always give credit to the original authors by citing your sources using the appropriate citation style (APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.).</li>
                    <li><strong>Use Quotation Marks:</strong> If you are using someone else’s exact words, place them in quotation marks and provide a citation.</li>
